Teachers ask students to write essays. Writing essays helps students to improve how they think and write. Writing essays shows a teacher what the student knows about a topic or issue. Think of an essay like the picture below - two people trying got get their point across, but in writing.</p><p>Essays often answer a question set by the teacher. Read the question carefully because the question tells you what to write your essay about and how to write it. Let's look at 2 examples. A question like 'Do you think homework should be banned on weekends?' is telling you to </p><ul><li>>agree or disagree about homework on weekends</li><li>give some ideas to back up why you agree or disagree</li></ul>/p><p>A question like 'Why do some people agree with smacking kids?' is telling you to</p><p>DESCRIBE some points for and against smacking. That sounds easy, doesn't it!</p><p>So, essays are short pieces of writing about a topic or issue. Essays answer a question. Essays have ideas and points in them. Each main idea has a paragraph - have three main ideas and you have an essay!</p><ul><li> Read essay samples (open another side panel)</li></ul><p>You are going to plan and write a short essay on a topic.

			"Developing":"<p>What is an essay? An essay is usually a short piece of writing about a single TOPIC or ISSUE made up of more than one PARAGRAPH. Why write an essay? Teachers often ask students to write essays in schools and universities. This helps students improve their thinking and writing skills. Students can use essays to show their teacher what they know about a topic or how good they are at writing to ARGUE, INFORM or PERSUADE. Think of an essay like the picture below - two people trying got get their point across, but in writing.</p><p>When you write essays, you usually have a question that you must answer. You should read the question carefully because the question tells you what to write your essay about and how to write it. Let's look at some examples. A question like 'Do you think homework should be banned on weekends?' is telling you to agree or disagree, and then give some ideas or points to back up why you agree or disagree. A question like 'Why do some people agree with smacking children?' is telling you to describe points for smacking and points against smacking. Most essays have a PARAGRAPH for each main point.</p><p>So, essays are short pieces of writing about a topic or issue. Essays seek to answer a question. Essays have ideas and points in them. Each main idea has a paragraph - have three main ideas and you have an essay!</p><ul><li> Read essay samples (open another side panel)</li></ul><p>You must now plan and begin writing a short essay on a topic. This will involve you:<ul><li>brainstorming what your essay question means;</li><li>brainstorming ideas about the essay topic;</li><li>planning and writing your essay</li></ul></p><p>You can use the Activities icon on the left to learn more about essay writing.</p>",			
			"Flying":"<p>What is an essay? An essay is usually a short piece of writing about a single TOPIC or ISSUE made up of several PARAGRAPHS. Why might people write an essay? Essays are often written in schools and universities by students who try to demonstrate to their teachers or markers what they know about a topic or their ability to ARGUE, INFORM or PERSUADE. When essays are written in schools, there is often a question that students must respond to. It is the question that tells you the purpose of the essay.</p><p>For example, students may be asked by the question to argue for an idea (Q: Argue for why cars should be banned on city streets), to explain why something exists (Q: Explain why carbon pollution exists), to examine many sides of a problem or augment (Q: Compare the ideas of those who support smacking children and those who do not.) or to analyse a story or film (Q: Analyse the main ideas of the novel Waterwings). Each main idea has a paragraph and when the paragraphs are put together you have an essay!.</p><p>So, now we know that essays are short pieces of writing about a topic or issue, that essays can be written for a range of purposes, that essays often seek to answer a question, and that essays are often written by students who need to demonstrate to their teachers what they know about a topic or how to use language to communicate effectively.</p><ul><li> Read essay samples (open another side panel)</li><li>Difference between formal and casual language (open new window - reference)</li></ul><p>Your task is to plan and begin writing a 5 paragraph essay on a topic. This will involve you:<ul><li>choosing and/or brainstorming what your essay question means and what it is asking you to do;</li><li>brainstorming your thoughts and ideas about the essay topic so that you can write a response to it;</li><li>planning and writing your essay by drafting your essay paragraphs, which include an introduction, body paragraphs and a conclusion.</li></ul></p><p>You can use the Activities icon on the left to learn more about essay writing.</p>"
