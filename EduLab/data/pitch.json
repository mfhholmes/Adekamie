It needs to cover the essentials but no more, and you need to be able to dsitill your subject down to the barest bones to communicate it effectively.</p><p>Creating a 5-minute pitch for a complicated subject is hard, but good practice. The essential thing to remember is that you're not trying to educate your audience, but interest them. If they're interested, they'll want to be educated later. Getting your audience interested is difficult, but if you can't interest them in 5 minutes, you won't interest them at all, and your business depends on people being interested"
