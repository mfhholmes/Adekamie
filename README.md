Adekamie
========

With the death of the Adekamie project, and the servers shuttering, I'm opening the code base.

Adekamie aimed to solve the 'blank page problem' by creating a scaffolded writing environment that
guided the user through the process of writing an essay (or lab report, journal article, whatever)

We created a halfway decent technical demo (this project) that was experimented with in some schools and got a mostly favourable response
However we failed to discover a method for charging for it, and the team fell apart. Lessons were learned!

Feel free to use this code however you wish, but credit me with my contribution to your work, please.
