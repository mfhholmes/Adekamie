Adekamie
========

With the death of the Adekamie project, and the servers shuttering, I'm opening the code base.

Adekamie aimed to solve the 'blank page problem' by creating a scaffolded writing environment that
guided the user through the process of writing an essay (or lab report, journal article, whatever)

We created a halfway decent technical demo (this project) that was experimented with in some schools and got a mostly favourable response
However we failed to discover a method for charging for it, and the team fell apart. Lessons were learned!

The code base is incomplete (especially the server-side, as we got into a discussion about whether to use a CMS server or a standalone - now I'm coding servers in Go and this code looks a complete mess). The javascript client-side stuff is better but got kludged a bit.

Feel free to use this code however you wish, but credit me with my contribution to your work, please.
