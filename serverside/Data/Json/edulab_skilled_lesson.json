It is about a single topic or issue and it tries to make a point in an interesting way.</p><p>An essay is made up of more than one paragraph. Each paragraph has a main idea. An essay is not like a short story - it doesn't tell a story. It describes, argues, or analyses a topic.</p><p>Why do teachers ask students to write essays? Writing essays helps students to improve how they think and write. Writing essays also shows a teacher what a student knows about a topic or issue.</p><p>Essays often answer a question set by a teacher. Before you write your essay, read the question carefully. The question tells you what to write your essay about and how to write it.</p><p>For example, a question like 'Do you think homework should be banned on weekends?' is telling you to: agree or disagree about homework on weekends; and to give some ideas to back up why you agree or disagree. That sounds easy, doesn't it?</p><p>So, an essay is a type of writing about a topic or issue. Essays answer a question. Essays have ideas and points in them. Each main idea has a paragraph - have three main ideas and you have an essay!<em>You can read sample essays <a href='http://gobrad.wix.com/samplesmag-edition1#!home/mainPage' target='_blank'>here</a>, or watch a short video <a href='http://youtu.be/nNmGf5NOeb4' target='_blank'>here</a></em>.</p><p>You are going to plan and write a short essay on a topic.

Essay writing helps students to improve their thinking and writing skills. Students can use essays to show their teacher what they know about a topic or how well they write to argue an idea or to inform or persuade a reader.</p><p>When you write an essay, you usually have a question that you must answer. You should read the question carefully. The question tells you what to write your essay about and how to write it. Let's look at some examples. A question like 'Do you think homework should be banned on weekends?' is telling you to agree or disagree, and then give some ideas or points to back up why you agree or disagree. A question like 'Why do some people agree with smacking children?' is telling you to describe the points some people make in support of smacking children.</p><p>So, an essay is short piece of writing about a topic or issue. Essays try to answer a question. Essays express ideas and support these with examples or evidence.

                "Flying": "<p>What is an essay? An essay is usually a short piece of writing about a single topic or issue. It is usually made up of several paragraphs.</p><p>Why might someone write an essay? Essays are often written in schools and universities by students who try to demonstrate to their teachers or markers what they know about a topic or their ability to argue an idea, or to inform or persuade a reader.</p><p>When essays are written in schools, there is often a question that students must respond to. It is the question that tells the student the purpose of the essay. For example, students may be asked to argue for an idea (Q: Argue for why cars should be banned on city streets), to explain why something exists (Q: Why does carbon pollution exist?), or to examine many sides of a problem or argument (Q: Compare the ideas of those who support smacking children and those who do not).</p><p>An essay is a long response to the question, and each main idea has a paragraph. When the paragraphs are put together, you have an essay!</p><p>So, now we know that essays are short pieces of writing about a topic or issue, that essays can be written for a range of purposes, that essays often seek to answer a question, and that essays are often written by students who need to demonstrate to their teachers what they know about a topic or how effectively they use language to communicate. <em>Read sample essays <a href='http://gobrad.wix.com/samplesmag-edition1#!home/mainPage' target='_blank'>here</a>, or watch a short video <a href='http://youtu.be/nNmGf5NOeb4' target='_blank'>here</a></em>.</p><p>You must now plan and begin writing a short essay on a topic.
