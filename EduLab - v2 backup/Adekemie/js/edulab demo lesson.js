			"Instruction" : "<p>What is an essay? An essay is usually a short piece of writing about a single topic or issue made up of several paragraphs. Why might people write an essay? Essays are often written in schools and universities by students who try to demonstrate to their teachers or markers what they know about a topic. In this situation there is often a question that students must respond to, and it is the question that tells the students the purpose of their essay.</p><p>For example, students may be asked by the question to argue for an idea (Q: Argue for why cars should be banned on city streets.), to explain why something exists (Q: Explain why carbon pollution exists.), to examine many sides of a problem or augment (Q: Compare the ideas of those who support smacking children and those that do not.) or to analyse a story, film or other text (Q: Analyse the main ideas of To Kill a Mockingbird.). These are just some examples.</p><p>So, now we know that essays are short pieces of writing about a topic or issue, that these can be written for a range of purposes, and that essays are often written by students who attempt to demonstrate to their teachers what they know about a topic, idea or text. Importantly, because your essay is to be read by your teacher it needs to be formal – that means you must write your essay using the kind of language you would use when talking to your teacher, and not using the kind of language you would use when talking to your friends in the school yard.</p><ul><li> Read essay samples (open another side panel)</li><li>Difference between formal and casual language (open new window)</li></ul><p>Your task is to plan and begin writing a 5 paragraph essay on a topic. This will involve you:<ul><li>choosing and/or brainstorming what your essay question means and what it is asking you to do;</li><li>brainstorming your thoughts and ideas about the essay issue so that you can write a response to it;</li><li>planning and writing your essay by drafting your essay paragraphs, which include an introduction, body paragraphs and a conclusion.</li></ul></p><p>You can use the Activities icon on the left to learn more about essay writing.</p>",

Most essay questions have two types of KEY WORDS. These are topic (or issue) words and task (or command) words. </p><p>Topic words tell you what the subject matter of your essay should be. Topic words describe the topic, issue or subject matter that you are to write about.

In the counter-idea paragraph you describe a point against your opinion.
