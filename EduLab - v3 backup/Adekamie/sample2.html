			<h2 class="annotated" ref="note2" note="The title indicates the topic or the essay">Raising or Killing Our Teenage Girls?</h2>
			<p >
<span class="annotated" ref="note2" note='Introduction paragraph. This raises the issue to be covered.'>Ever since I can remember, a girl’s appearance and physical attire has dominated her life.</span> <span class="annotated" ref="note3" note="The Writer chooses to use ‘I’ in this essay. She chooses a casual/relaxed style of writing and choice of words. Do you think that is appropriate? Is it effective?">Last century females would have their organs crushed and breathing limited by corsets in an attempt to make them look thinner. Should it be a surprise then that today 150,000 teenage girls die every year from Anorexia in the United States alone.</span> <span class="annotated" note="This last sentence states the writer’s main point. It states the essay’s thesis."> So,where does this pressure to fit a certain body image come from? I think it’s time to open closed doors and expose just how much pressure parents’ ideas about raising girls places on our teenage girls; our daughters, our sisters, our students, and our girlfriends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="annotated" ref="note4" note='The first sentence of paragraph tells the reader the topic of the paragraph.'>
			I feel passionate about this issue because I have personal experience of it.</span> Although I’ve never starved myself and gone without food for days like other girls I know, I made myself throw up after eating junk food once. I felt so guilty that I had let myself ‘pig out’ on a meal that soon after eating it I quietly and discreetly made my way to the bathroom. After doing it I made a decision. I decided never to do it again because of how stupid it was, and how worthless it made me feel. Sure, I still look in the mirror and see that I have imperfections. I see that I don’t have the preferred body shape. I have ‘fat’ days. I diet. It’s every girl’s way of thinking. But today I reflect more on why I think like I do and why I feel about my body the way I do.

Girls’ obsession with how they look is embedded in their life cycle: <span class="annotation" ref="note5" note='The writer chooses to describe her view of how girls are raised. She takes common events or objects and tells us how they may be harmful to girls. '>a girl is born, she is wrapped up in pretty pink dresses, hats, stockings, lace socks, hair ribbons and any other adornment that her parents can find to doll her up and show her off. ‘Isn’t she pretty?’ everyone says.</span> As they grow older, out comes the make up, plastic jewelry and the earrings. Heck! Why not pierce the child’s ears at 3 year’s old? ’Doesn’t she look so much more beautiful now with those two daggers of stainless steel stabbed through her ear lobes?’ 
			</p>
			<p>
Then comes the Barbies. Oh... the Barbies.<span class="annotated" ref="note6" note="'The writer uses a range of writing devices - descriptive and emotive language, rhetorical questions, irony (eg. saying things you don`t believe).'"> 30 centimeters of plastic that rip and hack at girls’ brains, staining their way of thinking for the next 30 years.</span> Shoved in our faces by parents, the television and shop pamphlets, these ‘toys’ force girls to believe that Barbies’ small waist, separated thighs, perky breasts and skeleton-like limbs are the ‘ideal’ female body shape. After all, barbie is ‘perfect’, isn’t she? If she is, then I’d better skip those three meals a day for a while.

As girls move into their teenage years, the influence of teenage girls’ magazines grows. The photoshopped pictures of skinny celebrities, the tips on dieting and the rules to finding a cute boy for Valentines (Rule #1: Always wear make up!) increases girls’ anxiety about and unhealthy obsession with their bodies. Thanks mum for buying me all of those magazines to read! 
			</p>
			<p>
With girls being raised in this environment, <span class="annotated" ref="note7" note="She refers to statistics to support her argument"> it is not surprising that the Anorexia Association reports that 68% of 15 year old girls are on diets and 10 out of 100 girls will experience anorexia or bulimia during their teenage years!</span> Just as concerning is the research findings that 85% of girls who suffered Anorexia or Bulimia during their adolescent years were pressured and influenced by the media, which include television and magazines. How many diagnoses is it going to take before the media realise that constantly shoving skinny models in our girls’ faces is going to affect their self-esteem and could harm them? 
			</p>
			<p>
<span class="annotated" ref="note8" note='Conclusion: Sums up the main idea and offers a solution.'>If we want girls to be healthy and happy, we need to make girls feel confident about themselves and their bodies. If this is to happen, then parents and the media need to pay less attention to the appearance of girls and more attention to their personality, their intelligence and their contributions to society.</span>
